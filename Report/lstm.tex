\subsubsection{Overview}
In this approach, we present  siamese adaption of Long Short-Term Memory(LSTM) network for labeled data contains pairs of variable-length sequences. This model is used to get the semantic similairty between the sentences using complex neural network. For this applications, we provide word-embedding vectors supplemented with synonymic information to the LSTMs, which use a fixed size vector to convert the syntactic meaning of the sentence. 

\subsubsection{Model}
It's a supervised learning model, where each data consists of pair of sequences $(x_1^{(a)},...,x_{n_a}^{(a)}), (x_1^{(b)},...,x_{n_b}^{(b)})$ of fixed size vectors along with a single label y(human labeled) for the pair. Note that sequences may be differenent length. These data will be pass to the model with a purpose of learning the semantics.

In the above diagram, there are two networks $LSTM_a$ and $LSTM_b$, each of them process a sentence in a given pair and predict whether  $LSTM_a=LSTM_b$ based on the similarity between the vectors. In each LSTM, the word vector is employ to the hidden layer and calculation is done and output is passed to the next hidden layer to remember the previous context and so on.

In above figure, the hidden layer which is core part of our neural network. It performs operation listed below on each word vector.
\begin{itemize}
\item The first sigmoid function is used to decide which information to keep and what to ignore
$$f_t=sigmoid(W_ix_t + U_ih_{t-1}+b_i)$$
\item Now it's time to update the old cell state into new cell state. The last step already decided what to do, in this step we just actually need to do it.
$$i_t=sigmoid(W_fx_t + U_fh_{t-1}+b_f)$$
$$c_t^`=\tanh(W_cx_t + U_ch_{t-1}+b_c)$$
\item In this step, we will multiply old state $c_{t-1}$ with $f_t$ to forget things we decided to forget earlier. Then we add to new candidate values
$$c_t=i_t \odot c_t^` + f_t \odot c_{t-1}$$
\item Final step defines what we actually need to output based on out filtered cell state and then $\tanh$(used to push values between -1 and 1) and multiply with sigmoid function to decide the parts we need to output.
$$o_t=sigmoid(W_ox_t + U_oh_{t-1}+b_o)$$
$$h_t=o_t \odot \tanh(c_t)$$
\end{itemize}

Above process are carried by both the LSTM and emploed to the Similarity Function given below, which calculates the Manhattan differnece between the ouputs.
$$g(h_{T_a}^{(a)},h_{T_b}^{(b)})=\exp(\textendash \parallel h_{T_a}^{(a)} \textendash h_{T_b}^{(b)}\parallel_1) \in [0,1]. $$
